# TODO list
This TODO list contains all of the features/additions we do. This list is ordered by priority.
1. Add RLE file format support
2. Add a zoom in and zoom out functionality
3. Make it so that when you click on a block in the grid you add a new cell to that block
4. Add more comments to the code and generally add more documentation
5. Make a .desktop file for this program

If you can in any way help me do any of these things you are greatly appreciated!
